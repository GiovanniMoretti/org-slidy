This projects provides a glue to produce HTML Slidy based presentations from Org-Mode files.

INSTALL:
- copy org-htmlslidy.el somewhere in your Emacs' load-path

- (require 'org-htmlslidy) from your .emacs

- copy provided Org files into your sources directory

  $ cp htmlslidy.org  $ORG_SRC

- This archive contains slidy.js and slidy.css that was retrieved on Friday 2010-11-12 from:
     http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/scripts/slidy.js
     http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/styles/slidy.css

  Copy these files to your HTML export directory.
  Note: that export directory depends entirely on your Org setup. You might
  want to configure it using the `org-publish' feature. See
  http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.php
  for details.

- copy jquery.js and org-slides.js (from this project) at the right place

  $ cp jquery.js org-slidy-slides.js $ORG_HTML_EXPORT

Now you're ready to export an Org file as a HTML presentation. This will be
automatically achieved through regular HTML export, provided that your Org file
contains the "magic" line:

#+SETUPFILE: htmlslidy.org
